# Yurate

This is not a Google product.

Curate Youtube videos so that you don't miss any subscribed content.

## Why

I want to make a decision on every video for creators I subscribe to. And
sometimes it's hard to keep track of what I've already added to "watch later".

My workflow currently is:

1. Go to https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions
2. Go top to bottom, adding to "watch later"
3. Stop when I seem to remember having already processed these.

The new workflow is much better:

1. Load this web app.
2. Say yes or no to all videos from subscriptions.
3. The list is now empty. Next time I will only see listed videos that have been
   added.
