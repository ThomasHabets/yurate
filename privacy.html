<h1>Yurate privacy policy</h1>
<p>
Effective Date: 2024-07-31
<p>

Yurate ("we," "us," or "our") is committed to protecting your
privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information
  when you use our web application.
<ol>

  <li>No Data Collection

    <p>We do not collect, store, or process any personal information,
except within your browser. Our web app does not require user
accounts, but instead just uses your Google account, and we do not
track user activity. All interactions with the app are ephemeral and
occur solely on your device.<p>Since we have no information, we also
don't share any information with any third parties, external or
internal.
    
<li>YouTube API
<p>
Our web app uses the YouTube API to provide certain features. While
using these
features, <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/">Google's
Privacy Policy</a> and Terms of Service apply. We do not have access
to or store any data related to your interactions with YouTube
content.

<li>Cookies
<p>We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies to monitor your
behavior or preferences. Your use of the web app is entirely
anonymous towards us.

<li>Third-Party Links<p>Our web app may contain links to third-party
websites or services, including YouTube. We are not responsible for
the privacy practices or content of these external sites. Please
review the privacy policies of any third-party sites you visit.

<li>Security
<p>
Although we do not store any data, we take reasonable measures to ensure that our web app is secure and free from vulnerabilities.
<li>Children's Privacy

  <p>
Our service is not directed towards children under the age of 13. We
do not knowingly collect any information from children.

<li>Changes to This Privacy Policy
<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will
be posted on this page, and the effective date will be updated
accordingly.

<li>Deleting data
  <p>
    We don't hold any data on you. Whatever data Google holds on you can probably be deleted from <a href="https://security.google.com/settings/">their settings page.

      <li>Refreshing/updating youtube data
        <p>
          When you press "Get subscriptions", that's when your browser
          fetches your subscriptions.
        <p>
          When you press "Get watch later", that's when your browser
          fetches the content of the playlist you've designated your
          watch later playlist.
        <p>
          When you're not using the app, it doesn't interact in any
          way with your data, because the app itself, and its servers,
          simply don't have any data, or any credentials to access
          your data in Youtube.
        <p>
          We don't store the data anywhere at all except back into
          your Google account, as application specific data, that,
          again, we can't access. Only you and your browser can access
          that data.
